# Node WebSockets

## About
A chat application built with Sockets.io on Node.js, which started with [this](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) tutorial. I've since added EJS, Bower, Gulp, Bootsrap, SASS, Webpack, Babel and React.

**Note:** the babel-presets-es2015 package seems to be alergic to Windows.

## Development
* Run `$ npm install`.
* Run `$ bower install`.
* Run `$ gulp`.
* Run `$ webpack`.
* Run `$ npm start`.
* Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser.
